# Laser-Based Communication System

This project demonstrates a wireless optical communication system that transmits voice signals using a laser beam instead of radio frequency waves.

The system works on the principle of modulating the intensity of a laser light according to the input audio signal and transmitting it through free space. At the receiver, a phototransistor detects the light variations and converts them back into an electrical signal which is amplified and reproduced through a speaker.
