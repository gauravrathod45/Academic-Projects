# Automatic Object Counter for Industrial Counting System

## 1. Project Overview
The Automatic Object Counter is designed to count products automatically in an industrial environment. 
It reduces manual effort and improves counting accuracy using sensor-based detection and embedded logic.

This project was developed as part of academic coursework in the 4th semester and simulated using Proteus.

## 2. Objective
- To design a system that automatically counts objects moving on a conveyor.
- To reduce human error in industrial counting processes.
- To understand sensor interfacing and embedded system simulation.

---

## 3. Components / Tools Used
- Microcontroller
- IR Sensor (Object detection)
- Display Module (LCD / 7-Segment)
- Power Supply
- Proteus Simulation Software

---

## 4. Working Principle
1. When an object passes in front of the IR sensor, it generates a signal.
2. The signal is sent to the microcontroller.
3. The microcontroller increments the counter value.
4. The updated count is displayed on the display module.
5. The process continues for every detected object.
