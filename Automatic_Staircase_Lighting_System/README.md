# Automatic Staircase Lighting System

## 1. Project Overview
The Automatic Staircase Lighting System is designed to automatically turn ON stair lights when a person approaches the staircase and turn them OFF after a fixed time.  
The system improves safety and reduces power consumption by ensuring lights operate only when required.

This project was developed as part of academic coursework and implemented using sensors, logic gates, and timer circuits.

## 4. Working Principle
1. When a person is detected at the top or bottom of the staircase, the IR sensor generates a signal.
2. The signal is processed through NOT gates and sent to the NE555 timer configured in monostable mode.
3. The timer produces a pulse that activates the JK flip-flop.
4. The LED (stair light) turns ON for a predefined time.
5. After the delay, the output goes LOW and the light turns OFF automatically.
